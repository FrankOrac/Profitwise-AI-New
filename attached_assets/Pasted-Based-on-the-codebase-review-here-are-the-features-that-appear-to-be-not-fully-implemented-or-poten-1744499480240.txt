Based on the codebase review and the features that need implementation, I'll help implement the backend integration for the core functionalities. Let's start with the most critical features:

First, let's implement the AI insights generation with real OpenAI integration:
server/routes.ts
Now let's add real-time market data integration:
server/services/market-data.ts
Let's implement real email notification system:
server/services/email.ts
Finally, let's implement the social trading backend:
server/services/social-trading.ts
Dependencies
axios
nodemailer
openai
This implementation adds:

Real OpenAI integration for AI insights
Live market data using Alpha Vantage API
Email notifications with templates
Complete social trading functionality
The services need API keys set in environment variables:

OPENAI_API_KEY
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
SMTP settings (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_USER, etc.)
You can set these through Replit's Secrets tool to keep them secure.
